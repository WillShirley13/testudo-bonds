# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines comprehensive testing requirements for the Testudo Bonds Solana program. The testing suite must validate all program functionality, edge cases, and security measures including signer verification, PDA assertions, token account validations, and business logic constraints. The tests will ensure the program operates securely and correctly under all conditions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core Instruction Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive tests for all program instructions, so that I can verify the basic functionality works as expected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN InitializeAdmin instruction is called with valid parameters THEN the system SHALL create a global admin PDA with correct data
2. WHEN CreateUser instruction is called with valid parameters THEN the system SHALL create a user PDA with initialized state
3. WHEN InitializeBond instruction is called with valid parameters THEN the system SHALL create a bond PDA and transfer tokens correctly
4. WHEN ProcessClaim instruction is called with valid parameters THEN the system SHALL calculate and distribute rewards correctly
5. WHEN UpdateAdmin instruction is called with valid parameters THEN the system SHALL update admin configuration successfully

### Requirement 2: Security and Access Control Testing

**User Story:** As a security auditor, I want tests that verify all access controls and authorization checks, so that unauthorized operations are prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an instruction is called without required signers THEN the system SHALL reject the transaction with ExpectedSignerAccount error
2. WHEN an instruction is called with incorrect authority THEN the system SHALL reject the transaction with AccountMismatch error
3. WHEN PDA derivation is incorrect THEN the system SHALL reject the transaction with InvalidPda error
4. WHEN token account ownership is incorrect THEN the system SHALL reject the transaction with InvalidTokenAccounts error
5. WHEN program account validation fails THEN the system SHALL reject the transaction with IncorrectProgramId error
6. WHEN account state validation fails THEN the system SHALL reject the transaction with appropriate custom error

### Requirement 3: Edge Case and Boundary Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tests that cover edge cases and boundary conditions, so that the program handles unusual scenarios gracefully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user attempts to create more bonds than max_bonds_per_wallet THEN the system SHALL reject with MaxBondsReached error
2. WHEN user attempts to claim from inactive bond THEN the system SHALL reject with BondNotActive error
3. WHEN user attempts to claim with insufficient rewards pool balance THEN the system SHALL reject with InsufficientRewards error
4. WHEN user attempts to create bond without sufficient tokens THEN the system SHALL reject with InsufficientTokens error
5. WHEN bond operations are paused THEN the system SHALL reject bond creation and claims with BondOperationsPaused error
6. WHEN claim penalty conditions are met THEN the system SHALL apply correct penalty calculations
7. WHEN bond reaches maximum emission cap THEN the system SHALL deactivate bond and close account

### Requirement 4: Token Economics and Calculation Testing

**User Story:** As a protocol designer, I want tests that verify all token calculations and distributions, so that the economic model functions correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN bond is created THEN the system SHALL split 10 tokens according to token_deposit_split ratios
2. WHEN rewards are claimed THEN the system SHALL calculate pro-rata emissions based on time elapsed
3. WHEN early claim penalty applies THEN the system SHALL reduce rewards by claim_penalty percentage
4. WHEN auto-compound is triggered THEN the system SHALL create new bond and adjust reward distribution
5. WHEN bond reaches emission cap THEN the system SHALL limit final claim to remaining allowable amount
6. WHEN multiple bonds exist THEN the system SHALL track rewards independently for each bond

### Requirement 5: Account State Management Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tests that verify account state transitions and data integrity, so that program state remains consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accounts are created THEN the system SHALL initialize with correct default values
2. WHEN account data is updated THEN the system SHALL serialize and deserialize correctly
3. WHEN bonds are created THEN the system SHALL update user account bond tracking correctly
4. WHEN bonds are closed THEN the system SHALL remove from active bonds list and update counters
5. WHEN account relationships change THEN the system SHALL maintain referential integrity
6. WHEN concurrent operations occur THEN the system SHALL handle state updates atomically

### Requirement 6: Integration and End-to-End Testing

**User Story:** As a user, I want tests that simulate complete user workflows, so that the entire system works together seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN complete admin setup workflow is executed THEN the system SHALL initialize all required accounts and configurations
2. WHEN complete user onboarding workflow is executed THEN the system SHALL create user account and first bond successfully
3. WHEN complete claim and compound workflow is executed THEN the system SHALL process rewards and create new bonds correctly
4. WHEN multiple users interact simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent operations without conflicts
5. WHEN system reaches capacity limits THEN the system SHALL enforce constraints consistently

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and Recovery Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tests that verify error conditions and recovery scenarios, so that the system fails gracefully and provides clear feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN invalid instruction data is provided THEN the system SHALL return InvalidInstructionData error
2. WHEN account deserialization fails THEN the system SHALL return DeserializationError
3. WHEN numerical overflow occurs THEN the system SHALL return NumericalOverflow error
4. WHEN invalid bond index is used THEN the system SHALL return InvalidBondIndex error
5. WHEN system constraints are violated THEN the system SHALL return appropriate custom errors with descriptive messages

### Requirement 8: Performance and Gas Optimization Testing

**User Story:** As a cost-conscious user, I want tests that verify transaction costs and performance, so that operations remain affordable and efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN instructions are executed THEN the system SHALL consume reasonable compute units within Solana limits
2. WHEN account rent is calculated THEN the system SHALL use minimum required space for each account type
3. WHEN token transfers occur THEN the system SHALL minimize cross-program invocations
4. WHEN complex calculations are performed THEN the system SHALL optimize for on-chain execution efficiency
5. WHEN batch operations are possible THEN the system SHALL provide efficient multi-operation support
